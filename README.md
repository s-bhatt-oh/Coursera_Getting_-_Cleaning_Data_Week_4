# Coursera_Getting_-_Cleaning_Data_Week_4

This repo was created for the final peer-reviewed assignment for Week 4 of the Coursera class 'Getting & Cleaning Data'. It contains the following items:

run_analysis.R - code script that does the following:
  1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each   subject.
