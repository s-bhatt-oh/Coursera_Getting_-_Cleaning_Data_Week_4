Codebook for Final Peer-Reviewed Assignment

"run_analysis.R" contains 58 lines of code that performed the following steps:
  1) Reads in the provided data, including raw data, variable names, and activity labels.
  2) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  3) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  4) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  5) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  6) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  7) Examines the structure of the final tidy data set.
  
"final_data.txt" contains 180 observations and 68 variables. 
  -1 factor variable "activitylabel" generated by run_analysis.R
  -1 integer variable "subject" generated by run_analysis.R
  -66 numeric variables representing mean/sd of activities, generated by run_analysis.R
